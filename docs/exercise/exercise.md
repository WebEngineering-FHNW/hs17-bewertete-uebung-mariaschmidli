I'm particular proud of:


## Project grading 

Description html is given but contained html is invalid (two bodies).
Good attempt to use semantic tags.
The application did not start. After fixing bootstrap, it started but contains mainly
fake functionality.

"Working" functionlity is mainly that of a static web site.

Commit log is ok.
Tests are mainly fake.

I award an extra point for the nice styling of the landing page.

Total Grade: 3.7
